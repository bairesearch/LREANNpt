useEvolutionarySearch (Codex IDE GPT-5.1-Codex prompt):

Please upgrade SUUANN with option useEvolutionarySearch=True, that changes the current matrix (m x n) individual weight permutation algorithm to that of the paper "Evolution Strategies at the Hyperscale";

You will need to search the internet to read this paper (it is very new). I believe their ES algorithm operates as follows (you will need to check this with respect to both the paper and the diagram provided);
1. For each batch:
2. Creates N whole matrix weight perturbations, where each matrix weight perturbation is generated by;
3. randomly initialising 2 separate rank-1 tensors of shape mx1, and 1xn, and then multiplying these together to create a m x n weight update.
4. Fitness is then evaluated by;
5. adding the m x n weight update matrix (multiplied by a coefficient sigma?) to the existing matrix weight matrix (m x n) to create a perturbed matrix.
6. measuring the final network loss.
7. repeating process for each of N perturbed matrices.
8. weighting each perturbed matrix by the final loss, and then overwriting the matrix weights with a weighted average of the perturbed matrices.
